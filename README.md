Small World Network Implementation for Multiple Cities
------------------------------------------------------

This was a project I found on my laptop from my senior year of college.

I was unable to completely finish it during that year but it should be in a workable state (I did not test it)

The point of this was to simulate the Small World Network problem for multiple cities, this version goes so far as to wire up the "cities" across multiple nodes in a cluster.

The reasearch project (this being part) was then to simulate the spread of the flu among such cities. The spread of the flu piece was finished by the projects new owners after my graduation.

*The point of this being on here is preservation only*
